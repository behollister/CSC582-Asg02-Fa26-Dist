# Options Markets: The Domain You Will Model

## Why you are being asked to do this

**You write no code that simulates this market.** You will not build it. You will *model* it. The
only code you write is Mermaid script, which generates your UML diagrams.

This is the skill that comes before implementation. You take a system described in ordinary
language — like this document, written by someone who knows the business but not software — and
you turn it into a structure of objects.

Real requirements look like this. They arrive as prose. They contain things that vary, things that
cannot happen, and things that are true but never stated. Nobody gives you a list of classes.
Making that list, and defending it, is the work.

### What you will produce

**Take-home:** a UML class diagram of the part of this market described in §2 to §6 — what kinds
of thing exist, what each one knows, and how they relate — and two sequence diagrams that show
your objects at work. For each design decision, choose between:

- **inheritance**, when one kind of thing really *is* a kind of another;
- **interfaces or mixins**, when several unrelated kinds of thing share one capability;
- **multiple inheritance**, when one thing really is two things at once.

Each choice has a cost. A model that uses the same technique everywhere has not made a choice.

**In class:** you extend your own model with something else this document describes, with AI
assistants off.

Because there is no implementation, you cannot hide an unresolved decision. In code, a vague design
can be patched with a conditional and still run. In a diagram, it is visible.

## 0. How to read this

This document describes a **domain**. It is not a specification of a program: it has no class
names, no diagrams, and no advice about structure. Turning it into an object model is your job.

Read it like notes from an expert who knows the business well and knows nothing about software:

- **Mark what varies.** Words like "or", "either", and "it depends" show that something varies.
- **Mark what is fixed.** Rules that are always true are rules your design can rely on — and
  sometimes must enforce.
- **Mark what cannot happen.** Impossible things are as useful to know as possible ones.

Every term is explained when it first appears, and collected in the glossary at the end. No finance
background is needed. Where a formula matters, it is given.

## 1. What this market is

Most markets trade *things*. This market also trades **agreements about things**.

You can buy a share of a company. You can also buy an agreement that gives you the right to buy a
share of that company later, at a price fixed today. The agreement is not the share. It has its own
price and its own buyers and sellers, and it ends on a fixed date.

Three different things happen in this market:

1. **What exists** — the things that can be owned: shares, and agreements about shares (§2 to §6).
2. **How things are traded** — how a buyer and a seller find each other and agree on a price (§7).
3. **What happens over time** — agreements reach their end date, and are used or expire (§5).

---

## 2. Assets: things you can own

An **asset** is anything that can be owned and has a value.

The basic asset in this market is a **share** of a company, also called a **stock**. Owning one
share means owning a small part of the company. Shares can be handed from one owner to another.
Each share has a price in the market, and the price changes all the time. The current price is
called the **spot** price.

An owner's holding of an asset is a **position**: which asset, and how many units. A trader might
hold a position of 300 shares of XYZ.

---

## 3. Contracts are assets too

A **contract** is an agreement between two parties, with written terms, that obliges at least one
of them to do something.

**A contract is itself an asset.** When you buy an option (§4), you own it. It appears in your
account next to your shares. It has a market value that changes every minute, and you can sell it
to someone else. So a position can hold a contract in exactly the same way as it holds shares.

There is one important difference: **a contract has a life, and a share does not.** A share exists
for as long as the company does. A contract is created, it runs for a while, and then it ends —
it is **exercised** (used) or it **expires** (its time runs out). At any moment, a contract is in
exactly one of these states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Open** | The contract exists, and can still be traded or exercised |
| **Exercised** | The holder has used the right, and the contract has ended |
| **Expired** | The expiry date passed without exercise, and the contract has ended |

What may be done with a contract depends on its state. An expired contract cannot be exercised or
traded. A share is never "expired".

---

## 4. Options: calls and puts

An **option** is a contract that gives its owner the **right, but not the obligation**, to buy or
sell a fixed number of shares at a fixed price, on a fixed date.

Every option has these terms:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Underlying** | The stock that the option is about |
| **Right** | **Call**: the right to buy. **Put**: the right to sell |
| **Strike price** | The fixed price at which the shares may be bought or sold |
| **Expiry date** | The date on which the right can be used; after it, the option no longer exists |
| **Multiplier** | How many shares one contract covers — in this market, always 100 |

The **premium** is the price of the option itself. It is not one of the terms: the market sets it,
it changes all the time, and the order book of §7 exists to find it.

### 4.1 Two sides

Every option has a buyer and a seller, and their positions are different.

The **buyer** — the **holder**, who is **long** the option — pays the premium and gets the right.
The holder decides whether to use it. The worst case for the holder is losing the premium.

The **seller** — the **writer**, who is **short** the option — receives the premium and takes on an
**obligation**: if the holder uses the right, the writer must do the other side of the trade. The
writer has no choice. The writer's worst case can be much worse than the premium.

<!-- figure: short-call -->
![Profit or loss of the writer of a call with strike 105 and premium 2.50, per contract of 100 units, against the price of the underlying at expiry from 95 to 120. The line is flat at a profit of 250, the premium received, up to the strike of 105, then falls one for one. It crosses zero at 107.50 and reaches a loss of 1,250 at 120, and it keeps falling as the price rises.](figures/short-call.svg)
<!-- /figure -->

*The writer of the call in §4.2 (strike 105, premium 2.50). The most the writer can make is the
premium; the possible loss has no limit.*

For every option that exists, one party holds it and another party wrote it. The two positions are
created together, and they end together.

### 4.2 Calls and puts, with numbers

A **call** is the right to *buy* at the strike. The holder of a call wants the price to go up.

> XYZ trades at 100. You buy a call with a strike of 105 that expires in one month. The premium is
> 2.50 per share. One contract covers 100 shares, so it costs 250.
>
> - XYZ rises to 120. You exercise: you buy 100 shares at 105 that are worth 120. That is 15 per
>   share, 1,500 in total. After the 250 you paid, your profit is 1,250.
> - XYZ ends at 103. The right to buy at 105 is worth nothing, because you could buy at 103 in the
>   market. You let it expire. You lost the 250.

<!-- figure: long-call -->
![Profit or loss of a long call with strike 105 and premium 2.50, per contract of 100 units, against the price of the underlying at expiry from 95 to 120. The line is flat at a loss of 250, the premium paid, up to the strike of 105, then rises one for one. It crosses zero at the breakeven of 107.50 and reaches a profit of 1,250 at 120.](figures/long-call.svg)
<!-- /figure -->

*A call, strike 105, premium 2.50. The loss is limited to the premium; the gain has no limit.*

A **put** is the right to *sell* at the strike. The holder of a put wants the price to go down.

> The same stock is at 100. You buy a put with a strike of 95 for a premium of 2.00, so it
> costs 200.
>
> - XYZ falls to 80. You exercise: you sell 100 shares at 95 that are worth 80. That is 15 per
>   share, 1,500. After the premium, your profit is 1,300.
> - XYZ ends at 97. The put is worth nothing. You lost the 200.

<!-- figure: long-put -->
![Profit or loss of a long put with strike 95 and premium 2.00, per contract of 100 units, against the price of the underlying at expiry from 80 to 102. The line falls from a profit of 1,300 at 80, crosses zero at the breakeven of 93, and is flat at a loss of 200, the premium paid, from the strike of 95 upward.](figures/long-put.svg)
<!-- /figure -->

*A put, strike 95, premium 2.00. It is the mirror image of the call. Its gain is limited, because
the price cannot fall below zero.*

A call and a put have the same terms. They differ in one thing only: which way the shares and the
cash move when the right is used.

### 4.3 Where an option stands

Comparing the spot price with the strike shows where an option stands:

- **In the money** — exercising now would be profitable: a call when the spot is above the strike,
  a put when the spot is below it.
- **At the money** — the spot is at, or very near, the strike.
- **Out of the money** — exercising now would make no sense.

The **intrinsic value** is what the option would be worth if it were exercised now, per share:

```
call intrinsic value = max(spot − strike, 0)
put  intrinsic value = max(strike − spot, 0)
```

It is never negative, because the holder can always choose not to use the right. On the expiry
date, an option is worth exactly its intrinsic value times the multiplier. Before that date it is
usually worth more, because the price still has time to move (§6).

---

## 5. Exercise and expiry

In this market, an option can be exercised **only on its expiry date**.

**Exercise.** When a holder exercises, shares and cash change hands at the strike price. Exercising
one call with a strike of 105 means: 100 shares move from the writer to the holder, and 10,500 in
cash moves from the holder to the writer. Exercising a put moves them the other way: the holder
delivers the shares and receives the cash.

**Assignment.** When a holder exercises, a writer of the same option must perform. The exchange
chooses which writer, by **assignment**. The writer does not choose and gets no warning. Every
exercise creates exactly one assignment, for the same number of contracts.

**Expiry.** On the expiry date, every option that is still open is resolved. Options in the money
are **exercised automatically** by the exchange. There is a small threshold: an option in the money
by a tiny amount may not be worth the cost of exercising it. Options out of the money expire, worth
nothing. After expiry the contract no longer exists: it cannot be traded or exercised.

> **A rule that always holds.** Every contract in existence has exactly one holder and one writer.
> Added up across all accounts, the positions in any option always come to zero: +10 for the
> holders means −10 for the writers. This is true at every moment, not only at the end of the day.

---

## 6. What an option is worth before expiry

The premium of an option depends on:

- **the spot price**, compared with the strike;
- **the time left** until expiry — more time means more chance for the price to move;
- **volatility** — how much the price moves around. More movement means a higher premium;
- **interest rates**, because the strike is paid in the future.

A formula for these options exists — the **Black–Scholes–Merton** formula — and it is given to
you. You do not need to derive it or to understand its mathematics. Where the formula belongs in
your model is a design question.

One relationship between a call and a put on the same stock, with the same strike and expiry, is
always true:

```
call premium − put premium = spot − strike × e^(−r × T)
```

Here `r` is the interest rate and `T` is the time to expiry, in years. This is called **put–call
parity**. Because it is exactly true, it is a useful way to check a calculation.

## 7. How trading happens

Options and shares are traded on an **order book**: one book for each thing that is traded. The
book holds everyone's open offers to buy and to sell.

### 7.1 Orders

An **order** says: buy or sell, which contract, how many, and on what terms.

A **limit order** names the worst price you will accept — "buy 10 at no more than 2.50". If nobody
will trade at that price now, the order **rests** in the book and waits.

A **market order** names no price. It trades immediately, at whatever price the book offers.

Resting orders to buy are **bids**; resting orders to sell are **asks**. The highest bid and the
lowest ask are the **best bid** and the **best ask**, and the difference between them is the
**spread**.

### 7.2 Matching

When an arriving order can trade with a resting order, the exchange **matches** them, and a
**trade** happens. The rule is **price-time priority**:

1. **Price first.** Better prices trade first. For bids, higher is better; for asks, lower is
   better.
2. **Time second.** At the same price, the order that arrived first trades first.

Two results that are easy to get wrong:

- **An arriving order can trade at a better price than it asked for.** If you bid 2.55 and an ask
  rests at 2.50, you trade at **2.50**, the resting order's price. The improvement goes to the
  arriving order, never to the resting one.
- **An order can fill partly.** An order for 50, with 30 available, trades 30 now and has 20 left.
  What happens to the 20 depends on §7.3.

The book should never stay **crossed**, with a bid at or above the best ask. Orders like that should
already have traded.

### 7.3 Time in force

Each order says what happens to any part of it that does not fill:

- **Day** — rest until the end of the day, then cancel.
- **Good till cancelled** — rest until cancelled.
- **Immediate or cancel** — trade what is available now, and cancel the rest.
- **Fill or kill** — trade the *whole* quantity now, or trade nothing.

Fill-or-kill is different in kind from the others. Day, good-till-cancelled, and immediate-or-cancel
can be applied after matching: match first, then decide what to do with the rest. Fill-or-kill
cannot. Whether the order may trade at all depends on the whole quantity being available *before*
any of it trades.

### 7.4 A worked example

The asks resting in the book for one contract, in the order they arrived:

- order **A**: sell 20 at 2.50, arrived 09:31:02;
- order **B**: sell 5 at 2.50, arrived 09:31:40;
- order **C**: sell 25 at 2.55.

The bids are 20 at 2.45 and 35 at 2.40. An order arrives: **buy 30, limit 2.55, day**.

- The best ask is 2.50, with 25 available across two orders. The arriving order will pay up to
  2.55, so it trades.
- Order A arrived first at that price, so it fills completely: **20 at 2.50**.
- Order B fills next: **5 at 2.50**. The 2.50 level is now empty.
- 5 remain. The next level is 2.55, within the limit: **5 at 2.55**.
- Nothing remains. The order is complete, at an average price of 2.5083.

If the order had been fill-or-kill, the exchange would have had to check that all 30 were
available before trading any of them. If it had been immediate-or-cancel with only 25 available,
25 would have traded and the other 5 would have been cancelled instead of resting.

<!-- figure: order-book -->
Buy 30, limit 2.55, arrives. The book for one contract, before and after:

| price | bids before | asks before | bids after | asks after |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2.55 | — | 25 | — | 20 |
| 2.50 | — | 25 | — | — |
| 2.45 | 20 | — | 20 | — |
| 2.40 | 35 | — | 35 | — |

A fills 20 at 2.50, then B fills 5 at 2.50, then C fills 5 at 2.55. 30 bought for 7,525, an average of 2.5083 per unit.
<!-- /figure -->

### 7.5 Other order types

⚠ **WIP.** Listed here for awareness only:

- **Stop order** — waits until the price reaches a trigger, then becomes a market order.
- **Stop-limit order** — the same, but becomes a limit order.
- **Iceberg order** — shows only part of its size, and shows more as it fills.

---

## 8. A session, from start to end

**Listing.** The exchange lists options on XYZ, which trades at 100: calls and puts at strikes of
95, 100, and 105, all expiring in 30 days, each covering 100 shares. That is six contracts. Nobody
holds any of them yet.

**Trading.** A market maker offers the 105 call at 2.50. A trader buys 10 of them and pays 2,500.
The trader now holds +10, and the market maker has written −10. The positions add up to zero.

**The price moves.** Over three weeks, XYZ rises to 112. The 105 call is now 7 in the money, so its
intrinsic value is 700 per contract. It trades at about 7.60: the extra 0.60 is the value of the
time left.

**Expiry.** On the expiry date, XYZ is still at 112. The 105 call is in the money, so it is
exercised automatically, and the exchange assigns the market maker. 1,000 shares move from the
market maker to the trader, and 105,000 in cash moves the other way. The trader now holds shares
worth 112,000, for which they paid 105,000 plus the 2,500 premium.

**After.** The 105 call contracts no longer exist. Both positions are gone, and everything still
adds up to zero. The other five contracts are resolved in the same way: those in the money are
exercised, and the rest expire, worth nothing.

## 9. Questions worth answering on purpose

None of these has a single right answer, and this document does not give one. Each is a decision
you will be asked to explain.

1. A share and an option can both be owned, held in a position, and valued. What do they have in
   common in your model, and where does that live?
2. A call and a put differ in only one way (§4.2). How does your model express that difference
   without repeating everything else?
3. A contract has a life, and a share does not (§3). What does that require of your model?
4. Exercise and assignment always happen together, and positions always add up to zero (§5). What
   do these two facts require of the way positions change?
5. Where this document is silent on something your design needs, what did you decide, and why?

---

## 10. What this document leaves out

**Left out on purpose**, because you do not need it:

- Other kinds of contract: options on other things than stocks, options that pay in other ways,
  combinations of options, futures, and bonds.
- Other rules for when an option may be exercised, and settlement in cash instead of shares.
- How volatility and interest rates are estimated. Assume one fixed number for each.
- Auctions, multiple exchanges, fees, regulation, and taxes.
- Margin: what a writer must deposit to cover the obligation.

**Not finished yet, and not on purpose** — marked ⚠ above:

- Other order types (§7.5).

**When this document is silent, decide and record.** If your design needs something that this
document does not give you, make a sensible choice, write down what you chose and why, and
continue. That record is part of what you hand in.
